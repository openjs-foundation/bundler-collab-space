# OpenJS Bundler Collaboration Space

The Bundler Collaboration Space is the home for projects, developers, and stakeholders interested in the JavaScript bundling ecosystem. This space is chartered by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council (CPC)](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council) and operates under the [OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct](https://openjsf.org/code-of-conduct/).

This space provides a forum for discussion and collaboration. The primary goals are deciding bundler/tooling interoperability, ensuring consistent runtime behavior, and defining a common set of standards and APIs for bundlers.

## Get Involved

All are welcome to participate! We encourage participation from any and all bundler projects, tooling authors, framework developers, and runtime representatives.

* **Slack:** Join the conversation on the OpenJS Foundation Slack in the [`#bundler-collab-space`](https://openjs-foundation.slack.com/archives/C09PKE01LS0) channel. ([Request access to the OpenJSF Slack here](https://slack-invite.openjsf.org/)).

* **Meetings:** We meet regularly to discuss active topics. See the "Meetings" section below.

* **Discussions:** Feel free to open an issue or pull request in this repository to propose topics or start a discussion.
